# JavaFX-Code
Using JavaDB in a JavaFX Project

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Apache Derby database in a JavaFX project.
Derby or JavaDB as it is named in Net Beans is an ANSI compliant SQL database that can run as either an embedded database or on a network server. 

Our ZDerby project demonstrates how to use Net Beans to create a JavaFX application that uses JavaDB as an embedded database.

Files Included in the ZDerby project
ZDerbyController.java
ZDerbyMain.java
dbdata.css
dbdata.fxml

Intended Audience
Beginner to Novice 
If youâ€™re a professional programmer please do not comment unless you are willing to provide corrected code as I am a Novice and if I knew what was wrong I would have fixed it.

About the application
It demonstrates the use of JavaFX beans
How to place the java.jar in the Libraries folder to utilize DerbyDB as an embedded database
How to create a folder on C drive and place the JavaDB in that folder
How to programmatically create a database table with a primary key
How to use Prepared Statements to execute SQL CRUD with ActionEvents
Use of the PropertyValueFactory to display data in the TableView control 

I have included a word document that explains the code to the best of my ability.
I hope you enjoy the code and it shortens your learning curve with JavaFX and DerbyDB
